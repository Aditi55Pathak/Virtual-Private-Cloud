# VPC Implementation for a Production Environment

This project demonstrates the creation of a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** to securely host servers in a production environment with high availability and scalability. The infrastructure leverages multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**, an **Auto Scaling Group**, **Application Load Balancer**, and **NAT Gateway** for efficient and resilient resource management.

## Key Components

- **VPC**: A private network with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
- **Subnets**: 
  - Public: `10.0.1.0/24` (AZ1), `10.0.2.0/24` (AZ2)
  - Private: `10.0.3.0/24` (AZ1), `10.0.4.0/24` (AZ2)
- **Internet Gateway**: Allows public subnets to access the internet.
- **NAT Gateway**: Provides internet access to servers in private subnets.
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Dynamically adjusts server capacity based on demand.
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across servers in private subnets.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Multiple AZs** for redundancy.
2. **Public and Private Subnets** for resource isolation.
3. **Auto Scaling Group** ensures optimal resource allocation.
4. **NAT Gateway** in public subnets to allow internet access for private servers.
5. **Load Balancer** directs traffic to backend instances.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create a VPC** with the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
2. **Set up Subnets**: Two public and two private across different AZs.
3. **Attach Internet Gateway** and configure routing for public subnets.
4. **Deploy NAT Gateway** for internet access from private subnets.
5. **Configure Auto Scaling Group** to manage server capacity.
6. **Set up Application Load Balancer** to distribute traffic.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a secure, scalable, and highly available network infrastructure, ideal for hosting production workloads. With redundancy across multiple AZs, dynamic scaling, and secure internet access for private resources, it ensures high availability and efficient resource utilization.
